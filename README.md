Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This project predicts diabetes using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset.
I implemented and compared multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) and a Deep Learning model (ANN with TensorFlow/Keras).

  Features:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Multiple ML models (LogReg, RF, SVM, XGBoost)
- ANN with TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Interactive HTML Dashboard:
  - Model comparison charts
  - Feature importance
  - Dummy prediction form
